# Hello World in Different Languages

This is a simple Go script that prints "Hello World!" in different languages to the command line.

## Purpose

The purpose of this script is to help me get familiar with Go programming language.

## How to Run

To run this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official Go website.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the command `go run helloworld.go -lang=<language-code>`.

The `-lang` flag allows you to specify the language in which you want to be greeted. For example, to be greeted in Arabic, you would use `-lang=ar`.
